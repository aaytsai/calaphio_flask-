### Contribution guidelines ###

Please just make sure code is tested and is written well enough for other people to read it. Code quality is very important to make sure this codebase doesn't become unmanageable. PEP8 style guidelines are preferred https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ for nicely structured Python code. Don't do too many hacky things like hardcoding values or whatever so we can make this code nice and simple too. Also please use a rebase workflow for git http://randyfay.com/content/rebase-workflow-git so we don't have ugly merges in our git log.

### Who do I talk to if I need help? ###
